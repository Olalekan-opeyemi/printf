## **Our Printf Function.**

Hello there, and welcome to our custom C 'printf' function repository! This project is a collaborative effort between [Olalekan Opeyemi](https://github.com/Olalekan-opeyemi) and  [Chukwu Miracle](https://github.com/Mimifresh). WE aim to create our own implementation of the printf function from scratch.


### **About the 'printf' Function.**

The printf function is a wwidely used standard library function in many programming languages, including C and C++. It is primarily used to format and print output to the console or other output streams. Our goal is to create our own version of this powerful function, allowing users to customie their output and enhance their programming experience.

### **Key Features**

Our custom printf function which we developped as '\_printf' aims to provide the following features:

1)Variable Argument Support: Our function supports a variable number of arguments,similar to the standard 'printf' function. This allows users to pass different types and numbers of arguments t the function.

2)Format specifiers: We support a number of format specifiers, such as **'%d'** for integers , **'%x**' for hexadecimals and a few others. These specifiers enable users to format their output according to their specific format.


### **How Can you use "_printf"**

**Step 1.**

Clone the repository.

**Step 2**

Navigate to the project directory.

**Step 3**

Build the project using your preffered build system or compiler. For example , with GCC.

**Step 4**

Execute the compiled binary

**Step 5**

That's it!!
